// In other language, class A inherit class B, we call class B as Base/Super/Parent class
// class A as Derived/Sub/Child class.

// Now Onject B has the behaviors or methods, and we link Object A to Object B
// And we refer B is the Prototype of the A.
// Prototype is an essential parent of other objects.
